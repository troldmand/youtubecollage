Build locally: 
In popout_for_youtube/, run 'cake build'. In Chrome, enable developer mode and under 'Extensions': Load Unpacked and choose the popout-folder üöÄ Then it should be workin' for ya'. Confirm by opening a youtube video, and see if you can pop-it-out. If the title of the video says 'Dank for YouTube‚Ñ¢Ô∏è', then it's our submodule rockin'.
